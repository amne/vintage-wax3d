# ARCHIVE

* Wrote this around 2006
* IIRC my parents made a big effort to buy a new PC
* My first PC with a dedicated GPU. An ATI Radeon 5000 or something like that
* Most of my code is in header (.h) files.
* I just couldn't grasp the header/source idea so I put everything in header files.
* The entire logic lives in wax3d.h actually
* Particularly proud of Vector3D class with the overloaded math operations
* Second most fancy thing was the Mass class to add physics to objects (thanks NeHe GL - https://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/rope_physics/17006/)
* Used BSP (not balanced) to implement collision detection
